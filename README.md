## Task 0 - Watch "Code Smells and Feels" by Jenny Bryan

At this year's UseR conference, Jenny Bryan gave a keynote lecture titled "Code Smells and Feels", a video of this lecture is available on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oyiPBjLAWY) and a repo containing the slides and related materials is on [github](https://github.com/jennybc/code-smells-and-feels).

This talk is a wonderful introduction into what good R code should look like as well as the process of refactoring existing code to improve its overall quality. I strongly recommend that you take 55 minutes or so to watch the lecture in its entirety.


## Task 1 - Re-Implement FizzBuzz 

For this homework you have been assigned to a group that includes 2 or 3 other students from the class, these groups were constructed randomly and will change for each subsequent assignment. Your initial repo master branch contains similar files to the hw1, however this repo also contains additional branches named after each team member which contains all contents of your hw1 repository.

Your tasks for this assignment is to combine all of your implementations together into a single clean / elegant / readable implementation of `fizzbuzz`. You should take advantage of the additional material we have covered as well as some of the  suggestions Jenny made in her talk to improve and streamline your implementation.

One additional wrinkle is that I have also protected the master branch on GitHub, this means that you will not be able to push directly to the master branch any more - instead you will only be able to push to your own branch which can then be merged into master via a pull request.

## Task 2 - FizzBuzz validation

Combine all of your collective test cases and validate that your new implementation produces the expected results across a wide variety of inputs.

## Submission and Grading

This homework is due by *1:00 pm Monday, September 17th*. You are to complete the assignment as a group and to keep everything (code, write ups, etc.) in your team's repository (commit early and often). One the work commited to the repositories master branch will be graded at the deadline.

The final product for this assignment should be a single Rmd document (a template of which is provided in your repo) that contains all code and text for the tasks described above. This document should be clearly and cleanly formated and present all of your results. Style and formating does count for this assignment, so please take the time to make sure everything looks good and your text and code are properly formated. This document must be reproducible and I must be able to compile it with minimal intervention - documents that do not compile will be given a 0. 

As with the first assignment we will not be enforcing any particular coding style, however it is important that the code you team produces is *readable* and *consistent* in its formating. There are several R style guides online, e.g. from [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) and from [Hadley Wickham](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/style.html). As a group you should decide on what conventions you will use and the entire team should conform to them as much as possible.
